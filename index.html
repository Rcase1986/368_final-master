	<h1>Robert Case</a>
	<h2>King of Kawaii</h2>
	</header>

	<article><p>Hello my name is Robert Case, and the people of the internet haved dubbed me the &#34;King of Kawaii&#34;
 which means &#34;king of cute.&#34; I am currently enrolled at Eastern Washington University to obtain a BA in Visual Communication 
and Design. Drawing is some thing I have enjoyed doing since I was in kindergarten and when I reached Junior High 
I realized it was some thing I wanted to do professionally. I have taught my self for many years how to draw with the 
computer and some my works have been the winners of contests and/or published in art books. I did some freelance for 
Wayforward Tech for their game <a href="http://riskysrevenge.shantae.com/">&#34;Shantae: Risky&#39;s Revenge,&#34;</a> 
two my drawings where published in the <a href="http://shop.capcom.com/store/capcomus/en_US/pd/productID.108031000/Street-Fighter-Tribute-Softcover-Book.html">&#34;Street Fighter Tribute Art Book&#34;</a> 
and the <a href="http://www.udonstore.com/Mega-Man-Tribute-HC-Udon-Store-Exclusive-p/mega-man-tribute-exclusive-hc.htm">&#34;Mega Man Tribute Art book,&#34;</a>
I did a comic for a iPhone game called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/orezom-trails-adventure/id735011469?mt=8">&#34;Orezom Trails&#34;</a> and one of my drawings was shown at the 2013 
San-Diego Comic-Con at a <a href="http://youtu.be/ixCBZM9G_78">&#34;Legend of Korra&#34;</a> panel.
